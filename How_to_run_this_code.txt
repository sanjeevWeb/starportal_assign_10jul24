Description:-

There are three services, service-users, service-notifications and service-websocket in this microservice architecture. running respectively on ports 4001,4002 and 4003.

service-users handle register and login of user, notifications handle the msg/notification by the users and websoket handles the real time data sending.

steps to run:-

1) RabbitMQ should be up and running.

2) (clone repo from github) ,Navigate to root directory, e.g- service-notifications and run >>npm install to install all dependencies.

3) run each service separately, cmd >> npm run start:dev

4) To test ,one can open the signup.html in the browser, signup there, then login and do the same in an incognito window to avoid the localstorage clash.

5) chat there , and it will be reflected in the other page as well.

note-> swagger ui was not behaving as expected, (will fix later), but due to time constraint I have documented in postman.(will attach)
